# knuth-morris-pratt
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm is a string matching algorithm used to find the occurrence of a pattern string in a text string. It uses a preprocessing step to create a failure function, which helps skip irrelevant comparisons and improves its efficiency compared to a simple string matching algorithm.
